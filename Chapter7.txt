						     the Frequency-Response Method

======================================================================================


===	  7–1 INTRODUCTION    ===

Frequency response and root-locus approaches are complementary

Used for robust control theory.

Pros: 	Can use data from measurements, without deriving mathematical model
		Investigate both absolute and relative stability with open-loop freq resp (Nyquist criterion)
		Lower noise influence
		Can be extended to certain nonlinear control systems.
		
Cons: 	The correlation between frequency and transient responses is indirect


Obtaining Steady-State Outputs to Sinusoidal Inputs
	
	s = jw
	G(jw) = M phase(phi)
	
	The steady-state response of a stable, linear, time-invariant system to a sinusoidal input does not 
		depend on the initial conditions and has the same frequency as the input
	
	x(t) = X sin(wt)
			   wX
	X(s) = ------------
			s^2 + w^2
	
	yss(t) = a e^(-jwt) + â e^(-jwt)
	
	from partial fractions
					w X				|			X G(-jw)
		a = G(s) ---------- (s + jw)|		= - ---------
				  s^2 + w^2 		|s=-jw		  2j
				 
			 X G(jw)	 
		â = ---------
              2j
			  
	G(jw) = |G(jw)| e^ (j phi)
	
		phi = phase(G(jw)) = atan( Im{G(jw)} / Re{G(jw)} )
		
		phi > 0; lead
		phi < 0; lag
		
		
Presenting Frequency-Response Characteristics in Graphical Forms

	1. Bode diagram (logarithmic plot)
	2. Nyquist (polar plot)
	3. Nichols plot (Log magnitude vs phase plot)
	
	
		
===   7-2 BODE DIAGRAMS   ===

Pros: 	Multiplication of magnitudes can be converted into addition.

Octave: 	w1, 2w1
Decades:	w1, 10w1

1. Gain K
	magnitude = 20log10(K) [dB]
	phase = 0°
	
2. Integral and Derivative Factors
	Integral
		magnitude = -20log10(w) [dB]  -> slope: -20dB/decade or -6dB/octave
			w = 0 => inf dB
			
			===================
			   IMPORTANT
			w = 1 => 0dB
			===================
			
			phase = -90°
	Derivative	
		magnitude =  20log10(w) [dB]  -> slope: 20dB/decade or 6dB/octave
			w = 1 => 0dB
		phase = 90°
		
3. First-Order Factors ( 1/ 1+jwT ) -> Low pass Filter
	magnitude = -20log10(sqrt( 1 + w^2*T^2 )) [dB]
		w << 1/T  => -20log10(1) = 0 dB
		
		w =  1/2T => -20log10(sqrt(5/4)) = -0.97 dB
		w =  1/T  => -20log10(2) = -3.03 dB
		w =  2/T  => -20log10(sqrt(5)) + 20log10(2) = -0.97 dB
		
		w >> 1/T  => -20log10(wT) 
		
	corner frequency at w = 1/T  (divides low and high freq regions)
		error is symmetric with respect to the corner frequency (see Fig 7-7)
		
	phase = -atan(wT)
		w = 0 	  => 0°
		w = 1/T   => -atan(1) = -45°
		w >> 1/T  => -90°
			*see pg 409 for more values
		
4. Quadratic Factors

	csi << 1 Asymptotic approximations to the frequency-response curves are not accurate
	
	
	magnitude: -20log10(sqrt( (1 - w^2/wn^2)^2 + (2csiw/wn)^2  ))
	
				w << wn  	=> -20log10(1) = 0 dB
				w >> wn		=> -20log10(w^2/wn^2) = -40log10(w/wn) [dB]
				
				w = wn 		=> corner frequency 
				near w = wn	=> resonant peak
	
				  2 csi w/wn
	phase: -atan(-------------)
				  1 - (w/wn)^2
			
				w = 0 		=> 0°
				w = wn  	=> -90°
				w -> inf	=> -180°
	
	
The Resonant Frequency wr and the Resonant Peak Value Mr
	
	wr = wn*sqrt( 1 - 2csi^2 )
		csi -> 0 	=> wr -> wn
		
		wr < wd = wn*sqrt( 1 - csi^2 )

				  1
	Mr = ---------------------
	      2 csi sqrt(1-csi^2)
		  
							 csi
	phaser = -90° + asin(-------------)
						 sqrt(1-csi^2)
	
	
General Procedure for Plotting Bode Diagrams

	Use normalized form:
		
		example:
					(jw + a)	            a* (jw/a + 1)
		G(jw) = -----------------  =>  -------------------------
				((jw)^2 + jw + b) 		b* [(jw)^2/b + jw/b + 1]
				
				
				
Minimum-Phase Systems and Nonminimum-Phase Systems				
				
	Poles and/or zeros in the RIGHT-half s plane are NONMINIMUM-phase transfer functions.			
				
	For a minimum-phase system, the magnitude and phase-angle characteristics are uniquely related			
				
	Nonminimum-phase situations may arise in two different ways. 
		1. System includes a nonminimum-phase element or elements.
		2. A minor loop is unstable.
			
	Nonminimum-phase systems are slow in responding -> Nonminimum-Phase-Lag
	
	
Transport Lag or Dead Time
	
	Also has nonminimum-phase behavior
	
	G(jw) = e ^(-jwT)
	
	magnitude: |coswT - j sinwT| = 1
	phase: -wT [rad/s] = -57.3 wT [deg/s]
	
	
Relationship between System Type and Log-Magnitude Curve
	Observe slope of the log-magnitude curve at low frequency
	
	1. Static Position Error Constant
		slope: constant -> horizontal line
		gain: 20log10(Kp)
		
	2. Static Velocity Error Constant
		slope: -20dB/decade
		gain: 20log10(Kv) at w = 1 (considering the asymptote -20dB/decade, not the actual gain)
		
	3. Static Acceleration Error Constant
		slope: -40dB/decade
		gain: 20log10(Ka) at w = 1 (considering the asymptote -40dB/decade, not the actual gain)

3. Quadratic Factors

	G(j 0) 	=  1 phase(0°)
	G(j inf)= 0 phase(-180°) -> tangent to negative real axis

	csi < 1
		G(j wn) = 1/(j2csi) phase(-90°) -> intersection with imaginary axis

	csi > 1
		tends to semicircle

	2. lambda = 1; Type 1 systems
		start: infinite, phase -90°
		low freq: asymptotic to a line parallel to the negative IMAGINARY axis
		final: origin, tangent to one of the axes
		
	3. lambda = 2; Type 2 systems

===   7-4 LOG-MAGNITUDE-VERSUS-PHASE PLOTS / NICHOLS PLOTS  ===

Pros: easy to determine relative stability
	  plots for G(jw) and 1/G(jw) are skew symmetrical about the origin


	
	
===   7-5 NYQUIST STABILITY CRITERION  ===

Determines stability of closed-loop from open-loop

Poles of characteristic equation must lie on the left-half s-plane

	1 + G(s)H(s) = 0

Experimentally determined frequency response may be used for stability analysis


# for a given continuous closed path in the s plane that does not go
	through any singular points, there is a correspondent closed curve in the F(s) plane
	

Assumption: open-loop G(s)H(s) is representable as a ratio of polynomials in s
			degree of denominator >= degree of numerator
			
			
Contour does NOT PASS THROUGH pole or zero

N: encirclements clockwise of the origin of F(s)
Z: number of zeros of F(s), within contour in s-plane
P: number of poles of F(s), within contour in s-plane (which is equal to poles of G(s)H(s))

N = Z - P

P can be determined from F(s) = 1 + G(s)H(s)

Z will become the CLOSED LOOP POLES, then Z must be equal to zero for stability

Contour: Nyquist path, encloses right-half plane (clockwise). 
		 Does not pass through poles or zeros at imaginary axis or origin

Evalute for s=-j(inf) to s=j(inf)

Encirclements of the origin of 1 + G(jw)H(jw) = Encirclements of (-1 + 0j) of G(jw)H(jw)

Plots of G(jw)H(jw) are symmetrical to G(-jw)H(-jw)


NYQUIST STABILITY CRITERION 
[ for a special case when G(s)H(s) has neither poles nor zeros on the jw axis]: 
In the system shown in Figure 7–44, if the open-loop transfer function
G(s)H(s) has k poles in the right-half s plane and lim s->inf G(s)H(s) = cte,
then for stability, the G(jw)H(jw) locus, as w varies from –inf to inf must encircle the
–1+j0 point k times in the counterclockwise direction.

	if P != 0, then N = -P. For stability, P counterclockwise encirclements
	
	if P = 0, then Z = N. For stability, NO encirclements
	
	Care must be taken when testing stability of multiple loop system.
		Simple inspection of encirclements are NOT ENOUGH. Use Routh-Hurwitz also.

		
		
Special Case when G(s)H(s) Involves Poles and/or Zeros on the jw Axis
	
NYQUIST STABILITY CRITERION 
[for a general case when G(s)H(s) has poles and/or zeros on the jv axis]: 
In the system shown in Figure 7–44, if the open-loop transfer function
G(s)H(s) has k poles in the right-half s plane, then for stability the G(s)H(s) locus,
as a representative point s traces on the modified Nyquist path in the clockwise direction,
must encircle the –1+j0 point k times in the counterclockwise direction.


=== 7-6 STABILITY ANALYSIS ====


N = Z - P
Z must be zero for stability


Conditionally Stable System (AVOID!)
	There is a range of open-loop gains that enables stable closed loop
	
	
Multiple Loop System
	Caution, inner loop may be unstable, but with outer loop system can be stable again.
	Nichols plot may assist on depeveloping a stable outer loop
	
	if a feedback loop is eliminated by means of block diagram reductions,
		possibility that unstable poles are introduced.
	if the feedforward branch is eliminated by means of block diagram reductions, 
		possibility that right-half plane zeros are introduced.
	
Nyquist Stability Criterion Applied to Inverse Polar Plots.
	May be applied to 1/G(s)H(s). It's easier to find right-half poles of 1/G(s)H(s) than the right-half zeros of G(s)H(s)
	In general, if experimental frequency-response data cannot be put into analytical form, 
		both the G(jw)H(jw) and 1/G(jw)H(jw) loci must be plotted.
