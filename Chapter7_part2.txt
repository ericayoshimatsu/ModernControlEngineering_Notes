===  7–7 RELATIVE STABILITY ANALYSIS  ===

Assumptions: 
	Unity Feedback
	Minimun-Phase Systems
	

Relative Stability Analysis by Conformal Mapping
	The closer the closed-loop poles are located to the jw axis, the closer the G(jw)
		locus is to the –1+j0 point


Phase and Gain Margins
	The closeness of the G(jw) locus to the –1+j0 point can be used as a measure of the 
		margin of stability. (This does not apply, however, to conditionally stable systems.)
		
	phase margin = 180° + phi
	
		gain crossover frequency (phi): w @ |G(jw)| = 1 = 0dB	
		
					    1
	gain margin = ------------
					|G(jw1)|
					
				= -20 log10 |G(jw1)| [dB]
	
		phase crossover frequency (w1): w @ phase(G(jw)) = -180°
		
		
	For a NONMINIMUN-PHASE system with unstable open loop, the stability condition will be 
		satisfied if the G(jw) plot encircles the –1+j0 point. Hence, such a stable 
		nonminimum-phase system will have negative phase and gain margins
		
		
	For stable systems having TWO OR MORE GAIN CROSSOVER FREQUENCIES, the phase margin is 
		measured at the HIGHEST GAIN crossover frequency.
		
		
	"For satisfactory performance, 
		the PHASE MARGIN should be between 30° and 60°, 
		and the GAIN MARGIN should be greater than 6 dB."
		
	In most practical cases, a slope of –20 dB/decade is desirable at the gain crossover 
		frequency for stability, for minimum-phase systems
		
	For NONMINIMUN-PHASE system use Nyquist diagram approcah rather than Bode diagram approach.
		
		
Obtaining Gain Margin, Phase Margin, Phase-Crossover Frequency, and Gain- Crossover Frequency with MATLAB.
		
	[Gm,pm,wcp,wcg] = margin(sys)
		
		Gm is the gain margin
		pm is the phase margin
		wcp is the phase-crossover frequency
		wcg is the gain-crossover frequency	
		
		
		
Resonant Peak Magnitude Mr and Resonant Frequency wr

	Open Loop

		C(s) 		wn^2
		---- = ------------------	
		R(s)    s (s + 2*csi*wn)


	Closed Loop

		C(s) 			wn^2
		---- = -------------------------	
		R(s)    s^2 + 2*csi*wn*s + wn^2


	wr = wn * sqrt(1 - 2csi^2)
	
					1
	Mr = ------------------------
		 2 * csi * sqrt(1-csi^2)
		 
		 
	The resonant peak magnitue gives an indication of the relative stability
		Great Mr: dominant poles with small damping
		Small Mr: system is well damped
		
	Easy to measure experimentally
	
	
	
Correlation between Step Transient Response and Frequency Response in the Standard Second-Order System.


	wd = wn * sqrt(1 - csi^2)
	
					
	Mp = e ^ -pi*(csi/sqrt(1-csi^2))
		 	


	1. Phase Margin and Damping Ratio are directly related

		rule of thumb (approx) => csi = phase margin / 100°
	
	2. For small csi, wd approx wr

	3. 	Csi and Mr are inversely proportional
		Csi and Mp are inversely proportional

	The time response of the standard second-order system can be predicted exactly
		from a knowledge of the Mr and wr of its closed-loop frequency response.
		
		
		
Correlation between Step Transient Response and Frequency Response in General Systems.

	Additional zeros and/or poles may change the correlation between the step transient 
		response and frequency response.
		
	For linear, time-invariant, higher-order systems having a DOMINANT PAIR OF COMPLEX CONJUGATE
		CLOSED-LOOP POLES:
		
		1. Mr is indicative of relative stability
		
				1.0 < Mr < 1.4  =>  0dB < Mr < 3dB
				
				corresponds to 0.4 < csi < 0.7
				
				
		2. wr is indicative of speed of transient response
		
			wd is somewhere between gain crossover frequency and phase crossover frequency
			
		3. For lightly damped systems: wr approx wd


Cutoff Frequency

	wb at which the magnitude of the CLOSED-LOOP frequency response is 3 dB below its 
	zero-frequency value
	
		|C(jw)|	   |C(j0)|
		------- =  ------- - 3dB,    for w > wb
		|R(jw)|    |R(j0)|

Bandwidth

	frequency between 0 <= w <= wb (cutoff freq)
	
	rise time and bandwidth are inversely proportional
	
	Spec of bandwidth may come from:
		
		1. A large bandwidth corresponds to a small rise time, or fast response
		2. High-Freq noise filtering
	
Cutoff Rate
		
	Is the SLOPE of the log-magnitude curve near the cutoff frequency. The cutoff rate indicates
		the ability of a system to distinguish the signal from noise.

===  7–9  EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF TRANSFER FUNCTIONS  ====

Frequency-response measurements to plot Bode Diagram. Then use asymptotic approximation to 
	determine transfer function and corner freqs.

Sinusoidal-Signal Generators
	Range: 	0.001 Hz to 10 Hz for large-time-constant systems
			0.1 Hz to 1000Hz for small-time-constant systems


Determination of Minimum-Phase Transfer Functions from Bode Diagram

	Draw asymptotes to the experimentally obtained log-magnitude curve 
		(slopes must be multiples od +-20deb/decade)
	
	Undamped natural freq: corner freq
	
	Damping Ratio: determined from resonant peak near corner freq and curves from Fig 7-9
	
	Gain: analyse low-freq
	
			lim G(jw) = K / (jw)^lambda
			w-> 0

	
		1. lambda = 0 (type 0)
		
			K = G(jw) for w << 1
			
		2. lambda = 1 (type 1)
			K = numerically freq at low-freq asymptote intesects 0dB
			
		3. lambda = 2 (type 2)
			sqrt(K) = numerically freq at low-freq asymptote intesects 0dB

	If phase at very high freq is not equal to -90(degree(num) - degree(den)), then transfer 
		function must be a NONMINIMUM-PHASE transfer function
		
		
Non-Minimum Phase Transfer Functions

	Computed vs. Experimental phase lag
		
		if 180° offset -> zero at right-half s plane
		if constante rate -> transport lag / dead time: 
			G(s)s^(-Ts), where T is the slope at high freq

			
	
A Few Remarks on the Experimental Determination of Transfer Functions

1. It is easier to obtain accurate amplitude than phase-shift measurements

2. Measuring Equipment should have a flat magnitude-vs-freq curve and phase angle proportional
	to the freq
	
3. Care must be taken due to nonlinearities. Input Amplitude. Saturation and DeadZone trade-offs
	Output must have a sinsoidal form, otherwise system is operating in nonlinear region
	
4. Sinusoidal test inputs may be superimposed on the normal inputs, so that the system does not
	need to be stopped. Use of stochastic signals (white noise) and correlation to obtain the
	transfer function
	

===  7–10  CONTROL SYSTEMS DESIGN BY FREQUENCY-RESPONSE APPROACH  ====

For any design use BOTH approaches: Root-locus and frequency

In freq-resp approach, transient response is indirectly specified

Transient Response is specified indirectly in terms of:

	Phase Margin				--|
	Gain Margin			    	  +-> estimated damping
	Resonant Peak Magnitude 	--|
	
	Resonant Frequency			--|
	Gain Crossover Frequency      +-> estimated speed of transient response
	Bandwidth                   --|

Use when deriving mathematical equations are difficult -> determine freq-resp experimentally

Freq-Resp approach is more conveniet when dealing with high-freq noise

First adjust open-loop gain to satisfy steady-state accuracy
Then check phase and gain margins. If specs are not met, then design a suitable compensator.


Information Obtainable from Open-Loop Freq Resp

	Low Freq (far below crossover freq): steady-state behaviour of closed-loop system
	Mid Freq (near crossover freq):		relative stability
	High Freq (above crossover freq): 	complexity of system
	
	
Requirements on Open-Loop Freq Resp
	Compensation: trade-off between steady-state accuracy and relative stability
	
	Low Freq: 	High gain (steady-state accuracy)
	Mid Freq: 	-20dB/decade (assure phase margin)
	High Freq: 	greater slope (atenuate noise)
	
	
Basic Characteristics of Lead, Lag and Lag-Lead Compensation

	Lead compensation: 	Improves transient. 
						May accentuate high-freq noise 
	Lag compensation: 	Improves steady-state. 
						Increase transient-resp time. 
						Supress high-freq noise effects
	Lag-Lead comp.: 	Use both
						Increase order of system by 2
						More complex and more difficult to control transient behaviour

					aTs + 1       aTs + 1


					
1. Determine K = Kc a to satisfy static error requirement

2. Draw bode with uncompensated sytstem Kc a G(s)

3. Determine necessary phase-lead angle and add 5° to 12° (gain crossover freq shifts to the right)

4. Determine a by the maximum phase lead required.
   Determine w where |Kc a G(s)| = -20log(1/sqrt(a)). w is the new gain crossover freq
   wm = 1/(sqrt(a)T)
   
5. Determine corner freq of compensator

	zero: w = 1/T
	
	pole: w = 1/(aT)
	
6. Determine Kc = K/a

7. Chech if gain margin is satisfactory
